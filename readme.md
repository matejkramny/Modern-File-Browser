Modern File Browser
===================

**What this is:**
- A web-based file editor (uses Ace editor)
- The intention of this is to make managing server files easier.

**What this isn't:**
- Production-ready
	- `Use at your own risk`

TODO & Bugs
-----------

- ~~Only works for files, trying to open directories will not work (have not tried)~~
- ~~It doesn't check the path for relative parts, therefore it may be possible to traverse high up the directory tree to access something else.~~
- Create and Delete files
- ~~Traverse Folders~~
- ~~Automatically switch style based on extension~~
- Be able to load/save/delete files over SSH/FTP Connections
